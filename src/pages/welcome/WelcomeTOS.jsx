export const TOS = `Here at FRACTO, we want to be clear on how things work. We're required to have a TOS and Privacy Policy to host this service and get it to you. But these documents are often wordy and hard to follow. So here is some information you need to know about using our tool:
We put a lot of hard work into this tool. Do not steal our code or work. We are here to share the findings and are open to working together. This is not open source, though.
   You can cancel your account with us at any time. We only want you here if you want to be here.
   We will not sell your data. That is not the data we are interested in! We may use the data you provide for a third-party tool to help the site (and how it interacts with you) work better.
